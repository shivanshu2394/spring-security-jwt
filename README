Hello,

This is a Spring boot application implementing Spring Security, JWT and usses Swagger UI for API Documentation.

After running the code go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/. Excute API naming Authenticate for generating JWT token. Username and Password for ths is "admin" and "admin".

After Generating JWT token, add the token in the Authenticate button on the top right side with "Bearer <JWT token>"

After authenticating, you will be able to assess the remaing APIs.

Thanks
